Edward R. Geary and Rev. William J. Monteith, the Presbytery of Oregon partnered with the people of Linn county to establish a collegiate institute on four blocks of downtown Albany, Oregon. Albany Collegiate Institute was incorporated with the state of Oregon on February 2, 1867.","Rev. William J. Monteith was Albany College's first president from 1867-1868. Montieth was the organizing pastor of the Albany Presbyterian Church, and the brother of Thomas and Walter Monteith, founders of the town of Albany. Montieth served as president of Albany Collegiate Institute for one year, during which he helped finalize the donation of land to the college from his brothers, secured articles of incorporation from the State of Oregon, raised money for the construction of the college's first building, and established the curriculum for the Presbyterian school.","Forty students enrolled, mainly in the lower grades, with fewer in the high school (preparatory) and college courses. Enrollment doubled by the end of November.","Rev. Edward R. Geary was commissioned by the Presbyterian Board of Education to establish churches and a Christian academy in Oregon. Prior to his presidency at Albany Collegiate Institute (1869-1871), he helped found the Presbytery of Oregon in 1851 and worked as a minister and judge in the Pacific Northwest. Geary was instrumental in planning and raising money to found Albany Collegiate Institute in 1867. ","The first five graduates of Albany College Maria Irvine, Cora Irvine, Weltha Young, Mary Hannon, and Kate W. Connor (not present in photograph).","Condit studied theology at Princeton University before relocating to the Pacific Northwest at the request of the Home Missionary Board of the Presbyterian Church. Condit served as President of Albany College from 1879-1885 and from 1887-1894. Noted for expanding Latin and science requirements, Condit also raised significant campaign funds for the College, most notably from the donors William S. Ladd and Senator Henry Corbett. ","The school adopted its first motto, <i>Esse quam videri</i> \"To be rather than to seem.\"","The school used a second motto, <i>Prodesse quam conspici</i> \"to accomplish without being conspicuous.\"","Albany students selected orange and black as the school colors to honor President Elbert Condit’s alma mater, Princeton University.","Adapted from the Princeton University song of the same name and set to the popular folk tune \"Sadie Ray,\" \"The Orange and the Black\" is designated as the official Albany college song.  ","Enrollment grew to nearly 100 students, prompting the renovation of the College Building. While this decision added substantial two-story wings to the original structure, it saddled the school with a debt that coincided with the Panic of 1893. The financial help of William S. Ladd and Senator Henry Corbett saved the college from closure in 1896.","Image: 1903. Albany Collegiate Institute football team. ","Wallace Howe Lee, a graduate of Williams College, joined the faculty in 1886 as professor of ancient languages. He was twice president of Albany Collegiate Institute, 1895-1905 and 1915-1920, and served as dean of men and registrar in later years. Lee served Albany College until his death in 1936.","Organized in 1899, the women's basketball team was a pioneer in the state. In 1905 the team tied with Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon State University) for the state championship. A play-off game was held at the neutral ground of the Portland YMCA. The Albany women won, 20-12.","The college celebrated \"Albany Day\" when “the last cent of the debt was paid,” and it gained a second building, Tremont Hall. ","The student newspaper, the \"Albany College Student,\" ran from 1897-1942, before being renamed the \"Pioneer Log\" to complement the newly established Lewis & Clark campus. The student-run newspaper is still published today. ","Formerly an orphan's home, the two-story building was given to the college by the Ladies' Aid Society. The women's dormitory was on the second floor, leaving room for a social hall and music room on the first. <br></br><p>Image: 1905. Tremont Hall with administration building to the right. Due to the Southeast view of the Three Sisters Mountains, President Lee named the new dormitory Tremont Hall. </p>","In 1905, the Board of Trustees officially adopted the name Albany College, transferred ownership to the Synod of Oregon, and established the Bachelor of Arts degree.","Crooks, a graduate of Wooster College, Ohio, was president of Albany College from 1905-1915. In this decade, he was responsible for building the existing $3,000 endowment up to $250,000. Crooks also eliminated the college prep academy to focus faculty energies on the college curriculum and ensure that Albany maintained its accreditation. Crooks left Albany in 1915 to become the president of Alma College in Michigan.","Albany College acquired forty-eight acres at the southwest edge of Albany. The site, purchased for $39,000 was named after founding member and first president, Rev. William J. Monteith. Architectural plans were drafted for a quadrangle of colonial-style buildings, however plans to move to the new campus were delayed for over a decade. ","Twenty-two of the thirty male students old enough to serve “answered the call to colors” in the spring of 1917.  The college did not have a football team during World War I, as the entire team had enlisted in the military. ","During World War I, Albany College and Pacific University (located about fifty miles north of Albany) engaged in a protracted, public debate over merging the two institutions. To complicate matters, Pacific had become nonsectarian in 1908, with full consent of the trustees, and the Congregationalists insisted that the merger must be “on an absolute nonsectarian basis.\" By 1919, the merger was dropped.","Albany College's Alma Mater first appeared in the 1917 yearbook the <i>Orange Peal</i>. With lyrics by college president Wallace Howe Lee and set to the tune of Cornell University's \"Far Above Cayuga's Waters,\" the song remains a signature of Lewis & Clark tradition today.\n","After a three-year hiatus from sports (1917-1919), Albany returned as the \"Pirates\" to good seasons in basketball, baseball, and tennis. The “Pirates” remained Albany’s mascot until the campus closed in 1938.  ","The college rented the Albany YMCA building and provided free rooms, showers and a gym for male students. For meals, the boys joined the girls at Tremont Hall on campus.","In the 1920s, the “Student Self-Help” program was formed by President Alfred Williams, and was further promoted by President Clarence W. Greene. The program’s aim was to give students the opportunity to earn part of their total expenses. The program's motto was \"to lend the helping hand that DOES NOT CARRY THE LOAD but helps the climber to CARRY HIS OWN LOAD.” However, amongst other complications, there were too few jobs available for students. By 1928, the college dropped the Self-Help program.","College president 1923-1928 and 1938-41, Greene received his bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan and his master's and doctoral degrees from Columbia University. He was a professor of physics at Michigan and Columbia before his presidency at Albany College. ","Albany College relocated to the forty-eight acre Monteith campus acquired in 1913. The campus featured Gray Hall, a new administration and classroom building, and a remodeled Tremont Hall, renamed Woodward Hall. ","Financial hardships impacted students and faculty at Albany College. Montague, in <i>Lewis and Clark College 1867-1967</i> writes, “Before the depression ended, faculty salaries were cut forty percent…. The president’s salary was cut in half…. Students were often unable to pay even the small tuition fees…. Faculty members also accepted student help in household tasks as part of payment of salaries.” While everyone struggled, faith in the college was strong. Miss Alice Graham, the librarian, remained at her post, receiving room and board as her remuneration for the year. Her commitment continued in 1938, when she moved with the college to Portland and established the library in the basement of the First Nazarene Church at Southwest Thirteenth and Main. In 1942, she moved the library to the newly acquired Palatine Hill Campus.","C.W. Platt, a Portland attorney, accountant, and trustee, sensed in 1932 that financial affairs were out of control. Platt drew in new trustees, renegotiated the mortgage, and staved off foreclosure by bondholders. <br></br><P> Image: ca. 1940. Students eating at Woodward Hall.</p>","Albany College attempted to improve its attendance by establishing a satellite campus in Portland. The college leased building space on Southwest 13th and Main from Temple Beth Israel, which provided room for classes. It also leased space in the basement of the First Nazarene Church across the street for a college library and provided gymnasium privileges in the adjacent Turnverein hall. \n","The Board of Trustees made the difficult decision to close the Albany campus and focus on developing a permanent campus in Portland. \n","College Board of Trustees recommended the purchase of Weatherly Heights, on Mount Tabor, for the new campus. The Weatherly Heights plan was abandoned in 1941 due to a lack of funds.","On June 30, 1942 the college purchased the Fir Acres Estate from the Lloyd Frank family for the \"token sum\" of $46,000. To accommodate the incoming class estate garages were converted to a library and classrooms, greenhouses used for science and art, and the manor house converted to a women’s dormitory and meeting hall. \n\n","A graduate of Occidental College, Odell became the first college president at the Portland campus. Under Odell's leadership the college negotiated the purchase of the Frank Estate, raised college enrollment from 145 to 1,200 students, expanded its facilities, and established itself as a respected liberal arts college in the Northwest. <P>Odell retired from Lewis & Clark in 1960 and went on to serve as interim dean of the American University in Cairo and vice president for development at Beirut College for Women.</p>\n\n","Trustees voted to change the institution’s name to Lewis & Clark College. The trustees selected Lewis and Clark as a “symbol of the pioneering spirit that had made and maintained the College,” grounding the  institution in a heritage of exploration and discovery.","The student body adopted the name “Pioneers.” <P>Enrollment increased as veterans returned from World War II. The college imported military surplus buildings to serve as classrooms, offices, dining commons, and a theater. </p>","The men’s basketball team became the first Lewis & Clark team to win a Northwest Conference title. As the “Outstanding Small College Team” in the Northwest Lewis & Clark played the Philippine National Team at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. Eleven of the twelve players were World War II veterans. ","The Pioneer football team won the NWC Championship with a perfect 9-0 record. They claimed the Pear Bowl Championship by defeating San Francisco State 61-7 and set ten school records that held for more than forty years.","Through successful fundraising, over 20 buildings were constructed during the Howard years, including but not limited to:<P> Aubrey R. Watzek Library, the Agnes Flanagan Chapel, Pamplin Sports Center and Zehntbauer Swimming Pavilion, Fir Acres Theatre, Olin Center for Physics and Chemistry, a number of dormitories, the law school complex and Paul L. Boley Law Library. </p><P>During President Howard's tenure the College of Arts & Sciences full-time faculty doubled. Student enrollment also doubled and included representation from the East Coast and international students from 49 countries.</p>","The college began an overseas and off-campus program. In this first academic year, students and their faculty leaders studied in Chile, Japan, Mexico, Peru and England.\n<P>Overseas programs immersed students in foreign cultures and gave them insights into American institutions and values by contrasting them with those of their host countries. <P>Today, students can study in: Arizona, Australia, Chile, China, Cuba, Dominican Republic, East Africa, Ecuador, England, France, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Morocco, New York City, New Zealand, Russia, Senegal, South Korea, Spain, Vietnam and Washington D.C.</p>","In 1962 the Columbus Day Storm struck the Pacific Northwest and Canada. Over 300 trees fell on campus, although few buildings were damaged. The building that sustained the most damage was the converted greenhouse, Peebles, which held the biology lab and art studio. Following the storm the building had to be entirely dismantled. ","President Howard implemented Reading Week, in keeping with the college's commitment to the liberal arts tradition and shared learning. Reading Week featured lectures, seminars, and informal exchanges between guest speakers that included author Ayn Rand, U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, Martin Luther King, Jr., Eric Hoffer, W. H. Auden, President Gerald Ford, Angela Davis, Norman Mailer, and Gloria Steinem, among others.","Image from the 1963 <i>Voyageur</i> yearbook. Accompanying text reads:<P> \"The college is keeping a steady pace with the changing world. The new dorm is a co-ed dorm with men and women on separate floors. This dorm functions under 'basic policies' formulated by the students themselves. Some of the new experimental policies designed to encourage mature thinking and student acceptance of responsibility are later hours for the women, inter-room visitation, and a judicial system on the apartment level.\"</p>","Founded in Portland in 1884 as the state law school, and in 1915 reorganized as the private Northwestern College of Law. In 1965 the school merged with Lewis & Clark College. Evening classes were held on the undergraduate campus until the law school complex was completed in 1970. Following a decade long struggle for accreditation, the school received American Bar Association approval in 1970 and joined the Association of American Law Schools in 1973. ","The first Lewis & Clark Symposium on Ethics and International Affairs was established.  The oldest student-run symposium in the United States. Organized entirely by students, this event concentrates on the most pressing themes and topics in international relations today. ","One hundred years after an initial partnership to establish a Presbyterian educational institution in Oregon, Lewis & Clark College and the Synod of Oregon agreed to sever their formal bonds. While affirming its historic ties to the Presbyterian Church, Lewis & Clark became an independent institution with a self-perpetuating board of trustees allowing new opportunities for expansion and federal funding.<br></br><p>Image: 1900. First Presbyterian Church in Albany, Oregon.</p>\n","Students watched as fire destroyed a major portion of the nineteen-year-old gymnasium, leaving only a few offices and classrooms in a usable condition. Damages were estimated at $250,000, with loss of sports equipment at $50,000. Plans were immediately drawn up to construct an improved sports pavilion and indoor swimming pool. ","Lewis & Clark has educated teachers since its earliest days, and in 1984 postgraduate programs in education, counseling psychology, and public administration were consolidated into what is now the Graduate School of Education and Counseling. The public administration program was transferred to Portland State University in 1996.","Lewis & Clark was the host school for the 17th Session of the College Model United Nations of the Far West. Charles “Chuck” Katungi, an international student from Uganda, was selected as Secretary-General of the session. After graduation from Lewis & Clark, Katungi joined the staff of the United Nations in New York as Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Uganda. ","<p>After two decades of work by Presidents Morgan S. Odell and John R. Howard to establish a central library building on campus, the Aubrey R. Watzek Library was dedicated on October 29, 1967. <p> Designed by Paul Thiry, nationally known for his work as the supervising architect for the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair, the Aubrey R. Watzek library, and later the Agnes Flanagan Chapel (1969), were designed in a modernist style with Northwest Coast Native American influences. </p><p>As part of the 1993-1995 Signature Project, architect Thomas Hacker expanded the southern wing, enclosed the ground floor, and relocated the main entrance to the lower north side. Following the renovation the library more than doubled in size and capacity. ","Pioneer athletics saw its most successful decade to date, winning 40 team championships, including 10 consecutive championships for the women’s tennis team.","A twenty-acre site in nearby Tryon Forest was purchased as a home for the Northwestern School of Law of Lewis & Clark College. Designed by architect Paul Thiry, the campus includes a library, student lounge, classroom buildings, and an amphitheater. <P> The Paul L. Boley Library houses Oregon's largest legal research collection, the second largest in the Pacific Northwest. </p>","The women’s basketball team earned the Northwest “B” District Tournament title, coming from behind in the final 30 seconds to defeat Oregon State. Volleyball won its third consecutive Northwest Collegiate Women’s Sports Association title and was ranked first in the Northwest in small college volleyball. \n","Opening for its first production in 1977, the Fir Acres theatre performance space includes two separate areas: the Main Stage offers seating for 225 people and the Black Box theatre has flexible seating for 125 people. <br></br><p>Background image: 1946.

In its 36 years, the symposium featured three days of workshops, lectures, film screenings, readings, performances, and academic panels.","The college adopted the new student governance model, which included the Student Academic Affairs Board (SAAB). SAAB’s responsibilities include helping formulate student policy on academic issues and granting funds for student-directed research.","Michael Mooney received his undergraduate degree from St. Meinrad College and his master's and doctoral degrees from Columbia University.
